Change History
--------------

2020.10.02
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Project updated for Python 3.8 with updated dependencies.

Removed RSS feed ``/rss`` (no longer included in latest version of Werkzeug).

Dropped support for installing on macOS, Red Hat, and Ubuntu.

Updated Dockerfile to build slim Python 3.8 image (the new image is ~198MB in size).
Docker will be the only supported method of running Patch Server going forward. Patch
Server remains a Flask application so manual installs can still be performed.

0.8.3 (2018-07-18)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Implemented restoring a patch archive backup via a new ``/api/v1/restore``
endpoint.

Switched from relative to absolute imports in code.

0.8.2 (2018-06-05)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed an issue where a mismatched or non-existing software title ID passed to
``/jamf/v1/software/<Title>,<Title>`` would result in a 404 error response.

The expected behavior is the invalid title ID to be omitted from the results
(this is the behavior of both the official Jamf patch feed and CommunityPatch).

Added documentation to describe resources for troubleshooting issues between
Jamf Pro and a Patch Server.

0.8.1 (2018-05-21)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

macOS quick install script. Updated daemon (removed ``KeepAlive``). Updated
documentation on managing the server using the Apache scripts.

0.8.0 (2018-05-11)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update a title's version from the UI.

**This updated contains a breaking API change!** Previously, the
``/api/v1/title/<title>/version`` endpoint required JSON provided in the
following format:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "Items": [
            {
                "version": "",
                "releaseDate": "",
                "standalone": true,
                "minimumOperatingSystem": "",
                "reboot": false,
                "killApps": [],
                "components": [],
                "capabilities": [],
                "dependencies": []
            }
        ]
    }

The intent was to allow multiple versions to be posted at once (the underlying
``create_patch_objects`` function takes a list of patches), but for easier use
and consistency with how the CommunityPatch API operates this has been changed.

The endpoint will now expect only the JSON of the version itself:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "",
        "releaseDate": "",
        "standalone": true,
        "minimumOperatingSystem": "",
        "reboot": false,
        "killApps": [],
        "components": [],
        "capabilities": [],
        "dependencies": []
    }

0.7.1 (2018-05-10)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updated documentation including:

- Installation instructions and resources for Ubuntu Server 16.04
- A new "Managing Your Patch Server" section to help document workflows.

0.7.0 (2018-04-16)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New webhook feature to allow the patch server to notify remote servers of
changes to software titles via HTTP POSTs.

0.6.0 (2018-02-14)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can secure the API with token authentication (if you really want to).

0.5.3 (2018-02-13)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because accurate and easy to read instructions are important.

0.5.2 (2018-02-08)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A minor renaming.

0.5.1 (2018-02-03)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make the GUI great(ish) again. The **New Title** button has been updated. It now
prompts you to select a JSON file (the patch definition) and performs the
upload. Validation is still performed on the uploaded file as with the API.

The new ``/api/v1/backup`` feature is available in the GUI. Click the **Backup**
button to trigger.

The **View** button for a software title has been moved to the right and will
take the user to the ``/jamf/v1/patch/{title}`` endpoint to view the JSON.

All GUI actions now provide feeback on success or error.

0.5.0 (2018-02-02)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Organized code. JSON validation for API. Really big documentation update (now
hosted on Read the Docs). Installation instructions for macOS and Docker.

Added ``GET /api/v1/backup``. Download a zipped archive of all patch definitions
on the server. Version history notes.

.. note::

   Removed most of the UI and some API endpoints no longer required without the
   associated UI views.

0.4.3 (2018-02-01)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The non-existent requirements file now exists.
