# ***** Jamf Title Editor *****

Jamf Pro customers running version 10.31+ have access to [Title Editor](https://www.jamf.com/blog/what-is-title-editor/), a free service to create and manage patch definitions using both a GUI and an API. It is a far more feature rich implementation of an external patch source, and users of this project should consider migrating.

The Patch Server project is unlikely to recieve any new feature or maintenance updates going forward.
